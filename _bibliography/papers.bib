	abstract = {The stability of the pickup ions in the outer heliosheath is a vital factor in the generation of the energetic neutral atom (ENA) ribbon observed by the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer according to the secondary ENA mechanism. Most previous studies of the pickup ion stability assumed simple, idealized velocity distributions of the pickup ions and focused on the parallel-propagating modes only. This paper takes a more realistic multicomponent pickup ion velocity distribution given by the global modeling of neutral atoms in the heliosphere and investigates the role of the oblique mirror waves, in addition to the parallel modes. Both linear kinetic instability analysis and hybrid simulations are performed. In contrast to a recent investigation using the same distribution that demonstrated the growth of parallel waves but reported an insigniﬁcant contribution of oblique modes, our study reveals substantial growth of the oblique mirror instability. The oblique mirror modes and the parallel/quasi-parallel ion cyclotron waves grow simultaneously with different growth rates. The pickup ion scattering by two types of excited waves together is more pronounced than by either type of wave alone. More importantly, our two-dimensional hybrid simulation results demonstrate that the development of the mirror instability not only produces its own pickup ion scattering, but also leads to the growth of extra ion cyclotron waves (in a quasi-linear manner), which further enhances the pickup ion scattering. The results suggest an important role of the mirror modes that should not be ignored in the stability study of the outer heliosheath pickup ions.},

According to our earlier linear instability analysis, pickup ion ring-beam distributions trigger magnetic ﬁeld-aligned, right-hand polarized unstable waves in two separate frequency ranges which are near and far above the proton cyclotron frequency, respectively. We have performed hybrid simulations to study the unstable waves near the proton cyclotron frequency. However, the high-frequency waves well above the proton cyclotron frequency are beyond the reach of hybrid simulations. In this paper, particle-in-cell simulations are carried out to study the parallel- and antiparallel-propagating high-frequency waves excited by the outer heliosheath pickup ions at different pickup angles as well as the scattering of the pickup ions by the waves excited. In the early stages of the simulations, the results conﬁrm the excitation of the parallel-propagating, right-hand polarized high-frequency waves as predicted by the earlier linear analysis. Later in the simulations, enhanced antiparallel-propagating modes also emerge. Furthermore, the evolution of the pickup ion ring-beam distributions of the selected pickup angles reveals that the high-frequency waves do not signiﬁcantly contribute to the pickup ion scattering. These results are favourable regarding the plausibility of the spatial retention scenario of the IBEX ENA ribbon.},

In this paper, several onedimensional hybrid simulations are performed to investigate the most unstable modes of different propagation angles predicted by the linear instability analysis.

In contrast, the present two-dimensional hybrid simulation results show that when both parallel/antiparallel and oblique unstable modes are acting together, the pickup ions can be scattered into the hemisphere of negative parallel velocities and approach a near-isotropic velocity distribution.

The pickup ion ring-beam distributions can drive unstable waves of different propagation angles with respect to the background interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, θ. Previous studies of the outer heliosheath pickup ion dynamics were mainly focused on ring-like pickup ion distributions with α ≈ 90° and/or the parallel- and antiparallel-propagating unstable waves (θ = 0° and 180°).

The maximum growth rate among all the instabilities belongs to the parallel-propagating left-helicity waves at most pickup angles. Furthermore, the evolution of the unstable mirror waves by varying pickup angle indicates that as the pickup angle increases, the maximum growth rate of the mirror modes increases, while its propagation angle decreases.},

Our linear instability analysis reveals that the unstable modes all have left helicity but may propagate parallel or antiparallel to the background magnetic ﬁeld. At small α, the parallel-propagating modes are unstable in two separate wavenumber (and frequency) ranges. The two unstable ranges merge into one when α increases to 82◦. In addition, the antiparallel-propagating modes become unstable when α is above 5◦, but the parallel-propagating modes have larger growth rates until α becomes larger than αc = 82.8◦.

            Proton cyclotron waves (PCWs) upstream of Mars are thought to be associated with the instabilities of pickup ions. The instabilities of pickup ions of ring distributions have larger maximum growth rates compared with beam distributions. However, observations revealed a notably‐reduced occurrence rate of PCWs for pickup ions of ring distributions. Linear instability analysis and a corresponding two‐dimensional particle‐in‐cell (PIC) simulation are performed to investigate the instabilities of pickup ion ring distributions upstream of Mars. Linear instability analysis indicates that a pickup ion ring distribution is unstable to the ion cyclotron, ion Bernstein, and mirror instabilities. The corresponding PIC simulation confirms the linear analysis results and further demonstrates that the pickup ions are scattered toward an isotropic shell distribution by the waves excited. Interestingly, the saturation energy of the waves is much lower than that driven by a corresponding pickup ion beam distribution, and mirror waves eventually dominate the system.

            Plain Language Summary
            Without the shielding of a global intrinsic magnetic field, the Martian exosphere interacts directly with the solar wind. Pickup ions are generated when neutrals in the exosphere are ionized and “picked up” by the solar wind. The instabilities driven by these pickup ions lead to the generation of proton cyclotron waves upstream of Mars. Despite that linear analysis indicates higher maximum growth rates for pickup ion ring distributions compared with beam distributions, observations show that the excitation of observable waves upstream of Mars is relatively rare with pickup ion ring distributions. The present study carries out linear instability analysis for pickup ions with a ring distribution. The results reveal that the ion cyclotron, ion Bernstein, and mirror instabilities are unstable. The subsequent particle‐in‐cell simulation validates the linear theory prediction and illustrates the scattering of the pickup ions by the enhanced waves. Interestingly, although the ion cyclotron instability has the largest maximum growth rate, it eventually diminishes and transforms into Alfvén waves. Consequently, the simulation is dominated by mirror waves in the late stage. More importantly, the wave saturation energy for pickup ion ring distributions is much lower than for beam distributions.

            The present study investigates the unstable waves driven by the pickup ions of ring-beam distributions with various pickup angles and pickup ion temperatures in the outer heliosheath, using both linear instability analysis and hybrid simulations. While previous papers have generally assumed specific pickup ion temperatures, this study takes a more comprehensive approach by examining a wide range of pickup ion temperatures that may occur in the outer heliosheath. Our one-dimensional simulations demonstrate that regardless of the initial pickup ion temperature, the pitch-angle scattering of the pickup ions at small pickup angles saturates before the pickup ions can reach the hemisphere of negative parallel velocities with respect to the background magnetic field in velocity space, while at a 90° pickup angle, the pickup ions of ring distributions attain a significant level of isotropy. In contrast, the two-dimensional simulation results show that at all pickup angles, increasing the pickup ion temperature only slightly reduces the pickup ion scattering rate, but does not prevent the pickup ions from reaching the hemisphere of negative parallel velocities. Overall, the results do not align with the requirements of the earlier proposed scenarios for the secondary energetic neutral atom (ENA) mechanism of the Interstellar Boundary Explorer ENA ribbon, which demand either weak pickup ion scattering in the outer heliosheath or at least incomplete pickup ion scattering in the off-ribbon directions.},

              The stability of a realistic multicomponent pickup ion (PUI) velocity distribution derived from a global model of neutral atoms in the heliosphere, which treats hydrogen and helium atoms self-consistently and includes equations for electrons and helium ions, is investigated using linear instability analysis and hybrid simulations. Linear instability analysis shows that the excited oblique mirror waves and the parallel/quasi-parallel Alfvén-cyclotron (AC) waves have lower growth rates than those obtained previously by A. Mousavi et al. for the PUI velocity distributions given by J. Heerikhuisen et al. The PUI scattering by each of the two modes alone is studied. In contrast to the previous investigations, our current simulations using the updated realistic distributions indicate that mirror waves alone do not effectively scatter PUIs in pitch angle. Instead, they primarily contribute to reducing the thermal spread anisotropy of the PUIs originating from the neutral solar wind. The unstable AC waves exhibit lower growth rates but higher saturation levels than the mirror waves. Two-dimensional (2D) simulation results show that when all unstable waves are present, the predominant contributor to the fluctuating magnetic field energy is the AC mode. The AC waves quickly scatter the PUIs with pitch angles away from 90

              toward isotropy, while the PUIs near 90

              pitch angle maintain a degree of anisotropy within our simulation timeframe. Moreover, several 1D and 2D hybrid simulations with different numbers of particles per cell are performed to examine the impact of numerical noise on PUI scattering. Finally, the implications of these results for the Interstellar Boundary Explorer energetic neutral atom ribbon are discussed.},
